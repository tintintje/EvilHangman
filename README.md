#EvilHangman Game 1.0 

# Description
This game app is quite like the original Hangman, where at game start the computer picks a random word and the
user must guess the letters to the word given 7 attempts. Rather than pick, say, a seven-letter word at the game’s start, 
EvilHangman instead starts of with a set of all possible seven-letter English words. If a user selects a frequent occoring 
letter, the computer just laughs instead of revealing the letter’s location(s).

# Features
  - Informs the user of all open letter positions, guessed letters for the current game.
  - Supports different on-screen keyboards.
  - Provides configurable variables: The length of words to be guessed, maximum number of incorrect guesses allowed and the game mode: evil or not. 
  - Supports simultanious game play.
  - Displays a history of high scores on game play end.
